                        <p>Without a doubt Japan's most recognizable landmark, majestic Mount Fuji (Fuji-san) is also the country's highest mountain peak. Towering 3,776 meters over an otherwise largely flat landscape to the south and east, this majestic and fabled mountain is tall enough to be seen from Tokyo, more than 100 kilometers away.</p>

                        <p>Perfectly manicured with the highest attention to detail, the gardens in Japan are truly works of art. To visit a Japanese garden is to step into a painting. Arguably the most beautiful garden in Japan is the Kenrokuen Garden in Kanazawa. The grounds used to be a part of Kanazawa Castle and were opened to the public in the 19th century.</p>

                        <p>Japan used to have over 25,000 castles but as time passes with wars, natural disasters and the movement of modernization, there are only 12 original castles left. Original castles mean having a castle tower (main keep) which was built during the Edo period or earlier. Probably the most popular castle for tourists is Himeji Castle in Hyogo prefecture. This beautiful white castle is often referred to as Shirasagi-jo, meaning White Heron.</p>
